# SUPERSTORE RETURN ANALYSIS

## Project Description
Analyze the reason behind the high number of returned orders at the Superstore by investigating root causes through various data visualizations, building a monitoring dashboard, and presenting the findings and recommendations to the CEO through a compelling 3-5 minute data story.

## Tools Used 
- Tableau

## Key Findings
- There is no strong positive correlation. There are well sold items with moderate to high returns. 
- Return rate by category shows all categories with similar average return rates (25–27%), suggesting issues are not category-specific
- Customer Behavior on Return rates. Top 60% to 100%. Identifying customers with consistently high return rates is key to uncovering issues with the items sold, customer service, or even violation of return policies. 
- Average returns vary in every state clearly peaking in California and Utah, suggesting geographic issues.
- Monitoring average returns rates monthly highlights key peaks in August, September, October and Dicember. 
- Monthly analysis of RR on ship mode by Region. It allows us to see how shipping speed may affect returns. August to December are the most affceted months in the West region
- High return rates appear to be linked to both shipping methods and regional performance, especially in the West during the later months of the year.
